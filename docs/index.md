**LegacyLink is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

LegacyLink offers a comprehensive family contact management system that simplifies the organization of large family trees, streamlines event planning, and helps maintain family connections more effectively than traditional contact management methods. It revolutionizes the "family experience"!

* If you are interested in using LegacyLink, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LegacyLink, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
